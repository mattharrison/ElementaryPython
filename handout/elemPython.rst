===================
Elementary Python
===================


Starting Python
===============
This is for Python version 2.  Windows users will need to install
Python from www.python.org.  It is included in Mac and Linux computers.

Type ``python`` into a *terminal*.  
(Windows -> run... -> cmd -> python)
(Mac Applications -> Terminal -> python)


.. class:: small

  All the examples here contain an *terminal* prompt (``>>>``).
  Don't type in the prompt.

Variables
=========

*Variables* are chunks of memory the computer uses to store
information.  *Variables* can have different *types*.

Strings
-------

*Strings* hold character data, like words and sentences.

>>> name = 'matt'
>>> lastname = "Harrison"
>>> about = """Matt was born many
... moons ago.  He likes 
... platters."""

Strings can be "concatenated" or joined.

>>> full_name = name.capitalize() + ' ' + lastname
>>> print full_name
Matt Harrison

Numbers
-------

*Integers* are whole numbers

>>> age = 10
>>> age_last_year = age - 1

*Floats* are real numbers

>>> miles = 10.0
>>> gallons = 3.2

Standard math operators are allowed (``+``, ``-``, ``*``
(multiplication), ``/`` (division), ``**`` (power))

>>> miles_per_gallon = miles / gallons
>>> print miles_per_gallon
3.125

Converting variables
----------------------

Turn a string into a number (use ``int`` or ``float``).  Notice that
``pets`` is really a *string*.

>>> pets = '4'
>>> num_pets = int(pets)

Turn a number into a string

>>> pets_2 = str(num_pets)

Lists
-----

*Lists* are used to hold groups of data.

>>> names = [name, 'fred', 'george']
>>> names.append('charles')

``range`` can be used to create a *list* of numbers.

>>> range(2, 10)  # numbers from 2 up to 10
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Comments
--------

*comments* are used as reminders to programmers.  Computers ignore
*comments*, but they are useful to humans.  Use ``#`` to start
*comments*

>>> grade = 4 # need to keep track of grade
>>> # You can also have just a comment by itself

Output
======

Use ``print`` to write to screen

>>> print name
matt

>>> print miles_per_gallon
3.125

Input
=====

``raw_input`` allows you to type data in.  Here it will be stored in
``friend``.  You might need to convert your *variable* into a number,
since the input is returned as a *string*.

>>> friend = raw_input("Enter a friend's name")
>>> age = int(raw_input("Enter a friend's age"))



Functions
=========

*Functions* are reusable code chunks.

>>> def add_5(number):
...     return number + 5
...
>>> add_5(2)
7


Whitespace
==========

Python denotes *blocks* by indentation.  Note that in the *function*
above, the line "return number + 5" was indented.  *Blocks* must:

  * Be indented consistently (4 spaces is ok)
  * Be preceeded by a ":"

Conditionals
============

Sometimes you want to take action if a statement is "truthy".  

=============== =============
"Truthy"        "Falsey"
=============== =============
``'not empty'`` ``''``
``1``           ``0``
``3``
``[1,2,3]``     ``[]``
``True``        ``False``
=============== =============

Common Conditionals
-------------------

=============== =============
Syntax          Meaning
=============== =============
``>``           Greater than
``<``           Less than
``>=``          Greater than
                or equal
``<=``          Less than
                or equal
``==``          Equal to
``!=``          Not equal to
=============== =============

If statements
-------------

``if`` statements indent the "block" following the truth.  There can
be zero or more ``elif`` statements and one or zero ``else`` statements.

>>> grade = 95
>>> if grade > 90:
...     print "A"
... elif grade > 80:
...     print "B"
... else:
...     print "C"
...
A

Looping
=======

Sometimes you want to repeat logic.  ``while`` or ``for`` statements
allow that.

>>> num = 2
>>> while num > 0:
...     print num
...     num = num - 1
2
1

>>> for num in range(1, 3):
...     print num
1
2

Can ``break`` out of loops

>>> for num in range(100):
...     print num
...     if num == 1:
...         break
0
1

Importing Libraries
===================

*Libraries* are collections of *functions* that are useful.

>>> import math
>>> math.sin(1)
0.8414709848078965


Getting Help
============

``dir`` and ``help`` or ``.__doc__`` are your friends

``dir`` shows the "methods" (or *functions*) on objects that you can
call.

>>> dir(math)
['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'exp', 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc']

``help`` shows the help documentation for a "method".

>>> help(math.sin)
Help on built-in function sin in module math:
<BLANKLINE>
sin(...)
    sin(x)
<BLANKLINE>
    Return the sine of x (measured in radians).
<BLANKLINE>

A simple program
================

Type the following into a file named ``name.py`` using a "text editor"::
  
  def greeting():
      your_name = raw_input('Please type your name:')
      if your_name == 'Matt':
          print "Hi Matt!"
      else:
          print name

  greeting()

Run your program by typing this into a *terminal*: ``python name.py``
